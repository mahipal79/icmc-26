          The most common types of papers accepted for publication are full
          papers (12-15+ pages) and short papers (&lt;12 pages), formatted in
          Springer Template, where a page constitutes 300-400 words. We only
          wish to publish papers of significant scientific content. Very short
          papers (&lt;6 pages) are not allowed.

      </h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You will have to send us the signed copy of License-to-Publish form as a
        scanned PDF, after the acceptance of your manuscript. The corresponding
        author (one per paper), who must match the corresponding author marked
        in the header of the paper, must have the full right, power, and
        authority to sign the agreement on behalf of all of the authors of a
        particular paper, and accepts responsibility for releasing this
        material on their behalf. Digital signatures are not acceptable. The
        corresponding author should be available to check the paper before it
        is published. Please note that once a paper has been delivered to
        Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the paper cannot be
        made. Authorsâ€™ names cannot be added or deleted, their order cannot be
        changed, and the corresponding author cannot be altered. The
        corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the
        corresponding author marked on the paper.
